# Autogain

---

A go script utilizing **_goroutines_** (i LOVE concurrency, I LOVE spamming my CPU with goroutines :))
for [rsgain](https://github.com/complexlogic/rsgain)'s custom mode.

Scans the subfolders of a root folder concurrently (GOROUTINES) for songs in each folder.
[Supported files](https://github.com/complexlogic/rsgain?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-file-formats) are added to
the rsgain custom command, then that is summoned concurrently (GOROUTINES!!! <3, i am terribly sleepy).

## Usage

:)
`autogain -h`

## Dependencies

- rsgain - have it installed and in your path
